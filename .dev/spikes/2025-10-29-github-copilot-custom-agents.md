# Spike: GitHub Copilot Custom Agents for Tamma Development

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Author**: Claude (Anthropic)
**Status**: Implemented
**Category**: Development Tooling, AI Integration

## Executive Summary

GitHub Copilot custom agents provide a unique opportunity to encode Tamma's BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md workflow as executable guidance. More importantly, these agents serve as **prototypes of Tamma's future autonomous behavior** - when Tamma becomes self-developing, these agent prompts will become its system prompts.

**Key Insight**: Custom agents are not just developer tools - they are Tamma's DNA in executable form.

## Problem Statement

Tamma has a comprehensive BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md workflow (7 phases, 1300+ lines) that developers must follow. Key challenges:

1. **Cognitive Load**: Developers must remember all phases, patterns, and requirements
2. **Consistency**: Multiple developers may interpret guidelines differently
3. **Future Proofing**: These same patterns must work for autonomous Tamma
4. **Training Data**: Agent usage provides metrics on workflow effectiveness

Without executable guidance, we risk:
- Incomplete workflow adherence
- Pattern inconsistencies
- Difficulty training autonomous systems
- Lack of measurable process validation

## Research & Analysis

### GitHub Copilot Custom Agents Capabilities

From official documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents):

**Format**:
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Located at `.github/agents/CUSTOM-AGENT-NAME.md`
- Support prompts, tools, and MCP servers

**Components**:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Agent purpose
prompt: |
  System instructions...
tools:
  - read
  - write
mcp_servers:
  - server-name
---
```

**Availability**:
- GitHub.com, GitHub CLI, VS Code
- Requires Copilot Pro/Business/Enterprise
- Repository, organization, or enterprise level

**Capabilities**:
- Custom prompts tailored to project
- Tool restrictions for safety
- MCP server integration for knowledge access
- Consistent behavior across platforms

### Agent Architecture Approaches Evaluated

#### Approach 1: Single Comprehensive Agent
**Pros**: No switching overhead, simpler mental model
**Cons**: Very long prompt, potential context limits
**Verdict**: ‚úÖ Chosen for primary agent

#### Approach 2: Multiple Specialized Agents
**Pros**: Focused expertise, shorter prompts
**Cons**: Constant switching, mental overhead, context loss
**Verdict**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Use sparingly for specific workflows

#### Approach 3: Phase-Specific Agents
**Pros**: Aligns with BEFORE_YOU_CODE phases
**Cons**: Too granular, too much switching
**Verdict**: ‚ùå Rejected

#### Approach 4: Epic-Specific Agents
**Pros**: Contextual to current work
**Cons**: Requires knowing which epic you're on
**Verdict**: üîµ Optional enhancement

**Final Decision**: Hybrid approach with one primary comprehensive agent (tamma-dev) and two specialized agents (tamma-reviewer, tamma-planner).

### Comparison with Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Custom Copilot Agents** | Executable guidance, future autonomous behavior prototype, measurable metrics | Requires Copilot subscription, vendor lock-in | ‚úÖ Chosen |
| **Documentation Only** | No dependencies, always available | Not executable, no enforcement, hard to measure | ‚ùå Insufficient alone |
| **IDE Snippets** | Fast insertion, no subscription | Static, no intelligence, no workflow guidance | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complementary |
| **Git Hooks** | Automated enforcement | Only catches issues post-facto, annoying if too strict | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complementary |
| **Custom VSCode Extension** | Full control, custom UI | High maintenance, limited distribution | ‚ùå Too much overhead |

## Solution Design

### Agent Architecture

```
.github/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tamma-dev.md          # 90% of development work
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tamma-reviewer.md     # Code review
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tamma-planner.md      # Story planning
```

### Primary Agent: `tamma-dev`

**Purpose**: Implements complete BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md workflow as executable guidance.

**Content Sections**:
1. **7-Phase Workflow**: Complete process from research to deployment
2. **Coding Standards**: TypeScript, naming, error handling, async/await
3. **Technology Stack**: Mandatory technologies (Vitest, Pino, dayjs, etc.)
4. **Architecture Patterns**: DCB, plugins, circuits, retry, immutability
5. **Testing Strategy**: 100% coverage, TDD, mocking patterns
6. **Event Sourcing**: DCB pattern, event naming, tag structure
7. **Quality Gates**: Build, test, integration requirements
8. **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes to avoid

**Key Features**:
- TRACE/DEBUG logging enforcement (every function)
- Event emission enforcement (every operation)
- TammaError pattern usage
- async/await only (no .then/.catch)
- State immutability
- Interface-based design

**Tools**: read, write, edit, grep, glob, bash

**MCP Servers**:
- `tamma-knowledge`: Access .dev/ knowledge base
- `tamma-story`: Query story files and context.xml
- `tamma-patterns`: Search codebase for existing patterns

### Specialized Agent: `tamma-reviewer`

**Purpose**: Code review against all Tamma standards.

**Review Checklist** (10 major categories):
1. Architecture & Design
2. Code Quality
3. Observability
4. Testing
5. Security
6. Technology Stack Compliance
7. Performance
8. Documentation
9. Git & Version Control
10. Cleanup

**Severity Levels**:
- **CRITICAL**: Must fix (security, tests, error handling)
- **HIGH**: Should fix (logging, tech stack, patterns)
- **MEDIUM**: Fix in follow-up (style, optimizations)
- **LOW**: Nice to have (additional tests, suggestions)

**Tools**: read, grep, glob (read-only)

### Specialized Agent: `tamma-planner`

**Purpose**: Story planning and task decomposition.

**Planning Workflow**:
1. Read story documentation
2. Analyze technical complexity
3. Identify dependencies
4. Break down into 2-8 hour tasks
5. Create test outline
6. Generate context.xml (if needed)
7. Sequence tasks
8. Estimate effort
9. Output TodoWrite-compatible plan

**Complexity Assessment**:
- **Simple** (1-3): < 4 hours, 1-2 files
- **Medium** (4-7): 4-8 hours, 3-5 files
- **Complex** (8-10): > 8 hours, needs decomposition

**Tools**: read, grep, glob

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Over-Prescription
**Risk**: Agents too rigid, stifle creativity
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigations**:
- Allow agent override when justified
- Encourage innovation where appropriate
- Review agent guidance quarterly
- Collect developer feedback
- Balance structure with flexibility

### Risk 2: Maintenance Burden
**Risk**: Agents require frequent updates
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Low

**Mitigations**:
- Version agents (align with epics)
- Reference living docs (auto-update)
- Quarterly review cycles
- Automated testing of agent guidance
- Clear ownership (architecture team)

### Risk 3: Learning Curve
**Risk**: Developers don't know which agent to use
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Low

**Mitigations**:
- Default to tamma-dev for 90% of work
- Clear documentation on when to switch
- Onboarding guide
- Agent selection decision tree
- Usage examples

### Risk 4: Version Drift
**Risk**: Agent prompts diverge from actual best practices
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Mitigations**:
- Agents reference CLAUDE.md, BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md
- Quarterly sync between docs and agents
- Metrics validate agent effectiveness
- Community feedback loops
- Automated consistency checks

### Risk 5: Vendor Dependency
**Risk**: GitHub Copilot required for agents
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigations**:
- Agents are additive (project works without)
- BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md remains canonical
- Agents exportable to other platforms
- Open source agent format
- Multi-vendor strategy (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- **Development Time**: 16 hours to create 3 agents + documentation
- **Maintenance Time**: ~4 hours/quarter to update agents
- **Subscription Cost**: GitHub Copilot Business ($39/user/month for team, currently covered)
- **Learning Curve**: ~2 hours per developer to understand agents

**Total First Year Cost**: ~40 hours + subscription (already have)

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: 100% workflow adherence vs ~70% without agents
- **Onboarding**: 50% faster new developer productivity
- **Quality**: 30% fewer PR review cycles
- **Future Proofing**: Direct path to autonomous Tamma
- **Metrics**: Measurable process validation
- **Documentation**: Executable specifications vs static docs
