# Epic 2 Retrospective: Autonomous Development Loop - Core

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Epic:** 2 - Autonomous Development Loop - Core  
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Participants:** meywd (Project Lead), Alice (Product Owner), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA Engineer), Elena (Junior Dev)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 2: Autonomous Development Loop - Core was planned as a 3-week epic implementing the fundamental 14-step autonomous development workflow that transforms Tamma from a foundational infrastructure platform into an operational autonomous development system. The epic encompasses issue selection through PR merge with intelligent provider selection, prompt optimization, and role-based orchestration.

**Key Finding:** Epic 2 is in pre-implementation phase - only 1 out of 16 stories (6.25%) has been drafted, with remaining 15 stories in "ready-for-dev" status. No actual development work has begun.

---

## Epic Status Assessment

### Planned vs Actual

**Planned Deliverables:**

- 16 stories implementing complete autonomous development loop
- Core workflow engine with 14-step process (issue selection → context analysis → plan generation → branch creation → test-first development → code generation → refactoring → PR creation → status monitoring → merge → auto-next)
- Role-based orchestration system with specialized AI agents
- Intelligent provider selection and prompt optimization
- Issue decomposition and task dependency mapping

**Actual Deliverables:**

- ✅ Story 2.2: Anthropic Claude Provider Implementation (drafted only)
- ❌ Stories 2.1, 2.3-2.16: All in "ready-for-dev" status (not started)

**Completion Metrics:**

- Stories Completed: 0/16 (0%)
- Stories Drafted: 1/16 (6.25%)
- Stories Ready for Dev: 15/16 (93.75%)
- Epic Duration: Planned 3 weeks, actual status: pre-implementation

## What Went Well

### 1. Comprehensive Technical Specification

**Epic 2 Technical Spec Achievement:** The technical specification (tech-spec-epic-2.md) is exceptionally thorough:

- Complete 14-step workflow sequence with detailed phase transitions
- Comprehensive data models and TypeScript interfaces
- Role-based orchestration architecture with capability matching
- Detailed acceptance criteria with traceability mapping to PRD requirements
- Risk analysis with 10 identified technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Complete testing strategy with 101 planned test cases

**Quote from Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The Epic 2 tech spec is actually masterful. Every workflow phase, data model, and integration point is clearly defined. When we start implementation, there will be no ambiguity."

### 2. Story Preparation Excellence

**Process Excellence:** All 16 stories have:

- Complete acceptance criteria with PRD requirement traceability
- Detailed technical context and implementation strategies
- Clear prerequisites and dependency mapping
- Comprehensive testing approaches (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Performance targets and non-functional requirements

**Quote from Alice (Product Owner):** "Bob's story preparation for Epic 2 has been exceptional. Each story is implementation-ready with clear success criteria."

### 3. Architecture Alignment

**Technical Foundation:** Epic 2 builds properly on Epic 1 foundations:

- Clear integration points with Epic 1's AI provider and Git platform abstractions
- Event sourcing integration planned for Epic 4
- Observability hooks designed for Epic 5 integration
- Hybrid architecture support (standalone, orchestrator, worker modes)

**Quote from Elena (Junior Dev):** "The dependency mapping from Epic 2 to Epic 1 is crystal clear. I can see exactly which interfaces I'll be working with."

---

## What Didn't Go Well

### 1. Complete Implementation Stall

**Critical Issue:** Epic 2 has not moved from story preparation to implementation:

- No development work started on any of the 16 stories
- Only 1 story (2.2) has progressed to "drafted" status
- Core workflow engine implementation not begun
- No AI provider integration work initiated

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- **Epic 1 Dependency:** Epic 2 depends on Epic 1 foundations that are incomplete (see Epic 1 retrospective)
- **Resource Allocation:** Development team not allocated to Epic 2 implementation
- **Priority Confusion:** Unclear if Epic 2 should begin before Epic 1 completion
- **Sequential Dependency:** Epic 2 cannot reasonably start without Epic 1's core interfaces

### 2. Dependency Cascade Failure

**Planning vs Reality:**

- Planned: Epic 2 builds on completed Epic 1 foundations
- Reality: Epic 1 is only 7.7% complete (1/13 stories done)
- Gap: Epic 2's prerequisites (AI interfaces, Git platforms, CLI scaffolding) are missing

**Impact:** Epic 2 is blocked by incomplete Epic 1 work, creating project-wide stall.

### 3. Technical Complexity Underestimation

**Scope Analysis:**

- Epic 2 combines workflow orchestration, role-based AI agents, state machines, approval systems
- 16 stories with complex interdependencies and real-time coordination
- Integration with 4 other epics (1, 3, 4, 5) required

**Quote from Dana (QA Engineer):** "Epic 2 might be the most complex epic in the entire project. We're trying to build autonomous development while the foundation isn't even complete."

---

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### 1. Sequential Epic Dependencies Create Project Risk

**Critical Insight:** Epic 2's complete dependency on Epic 1 creates single point of failure:

- Epic 1 incomplete → Epic 2 blocked → Epic 3 blocked → Entire project stalled
- No parallel work possible between foundational epics
- Resource allocation becomes serial rather than parallel

### 2. Story Preparation ≠ Implementation Capacity

**Process Learning:** Excellent story preparation cannot overcome missing implementation resources:

- 15/16 stories are "ready-for-dev" but no developers assigned
- Story preparation capacity exceeds implementation capacity by wide margin
- "Ready-for-dev" status creates false sense of progress

### 3. Complex Epics Require Foundation Validation

**Architectural Learning:** Epic 2's complexity demands validated foundations:

- Role-based orchestration requires stable AI provider abstractions
- State machine workflows need proven Git platform interfaces
- Approval checkpoints require reliable CLI infrastructure

### 4. Technical Debt Accumulation Risk

**Project Health Concern:** Delaying Epic 2 implementation increases technical debt:

- Epic 1's incomplete work becomes technical debt
- Epic 2's complexity will compound when eventually implemented
- Integration risk grows with each delayed epic

---

## Process Improvements

### 1. Dependency Management Reform

**New Process Required:**

- Implement "Foundation First" policy: No epic can begin until its prerequisites are 80%+ complete
- Create "Foundation Status" dashboard showing prerequisite completion across epics
- Weekly dependency health check with automatic blocker identification

### 2. Parallel Epic Execution

**New Guidelines:**

- Identify parallel work streams between dependent epics
- Allocate resources to maximize concurrent progress
- Use "Foundation Teams" vs "Feature Teams" structure
- Cross-train developers to work on multiple epic types

### 3. Resource-Ready Story Status

**Required Change:**

- Add "resource-assigned" status between "ready-for-dev" and "in-progress"
- Stories cannot be "ready-for-dev" without confirmed developer assignment
- Resource allocation must be visible in sprint status
- Weekly resource planning meeting to prevent bottlenecks

### 4. Epic Complexity Scoring

**Required Enhancement:**

- Score epics by complexity (1-5 scale) during planning
- High complexity epics (4-5) require validated foundations
- Complex epics need dedicated "Foundation Sprint" before feature work
- Complexity scores inform resource allocation and timeline planning

---

## Retrospective Meta-Notes

**Process Effectiveness:** This retrospective successfully identified that Epic 2 is blocked by Epic 1's incomplete state, preventing wasted implementation effort. The retrospective revealed a project-wide systemic issue with sequential dependencies.

**Key Success:** Early identification that Epic 2 cannot reasonably proceed without Epic 1 foundations, preventing wasted effort on blocked work.

**Critical Project Risk:** The current sequential dependency pattern (Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 3) creates single points of failure that could stall the entire project. Immediate corrective action required.

**Improvement Needed:** Fundamental restructuring of project execution to enable parallel progress and reduce dependency risk.
