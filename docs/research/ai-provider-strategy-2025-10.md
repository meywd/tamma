- **Year 2-3:** $50,000 (ops) + $200,000 (staff) = $250,000/year
- **3-Year Total:** ~$900,000
- **Average Monthly:** ~$25,000

### Depreciation and Obsolescence
- **Hardware Lifespan:** 2-3 years (rapidly evolving AI hardware)
- **Depreciation Rate:** 30-50% per year
- **Risk:** Newer, more efficient hardware may render current investment obsolete
- **Resale Value:** Limited market for used AI hardware

### Cost Breakeven Analysis

**When Self-hosting Becomes Cost-effective:**

For **8B models**, self-hosting breaks even vs. API costs at:
- **High Volume:** >50M tokens/day (~$100-$200/day at API prices)
- **Annual API Cost Equivalent:** $36,500-$73,000/year
- **Reality:** Most startups don't reach this volume initially

For **70B models**, self-hosting breaks even at:
- **Very High Volume:** >500M tokens/day (~$1,000-$2,000/day at API prices)
- **Annual API Cost Equivalent:** $365,000-$730,000/year
- **Reality:** Only large-scale production systems reach this threshold

### Advantages of Local Models
1. **No per-token costs** after infrastructure setup
2. **Data privacy:** All data stays on-premises
3. **Customization:** Full control over model fine-tuning
4. **Offline capability:** No internet dependency
5. **Predictable costs:** Fixed monthly expenses
6. **Low latency:** On-premises reduces network overhead

### Disadvantages of Local Models
1. **High upfront capital:** $5,000-$300,000+ initial investment
2. **Maintenance burden:** Requires dedicated engineering staff
3. **Operational risk:** Hardware failures, downtime, incidents
4. **Rapid obsolescence:** Hardware depreciates quickly
5. **Scaling challenges:** Adding capacity requires hardware purchases
6. **Opportunity cost:** Engineer time spent on infrastructure vs. features

### Recommended Scenarios for Local Models

**Good Fit:**
- High-volume production workloads (>100M tokens/day)
- Strict data residency/privacy requirements
- Air-gapped environments (government, defense, healthcare)
- Organizations with existing ML infrastructure and expertise
- Long-term commitment with predictable usage patterns

**Poor Fit:**
- Early-stage startups with uncertain usage
- Low-to-medium volume workloads (<10M tokens/day)
- Teams without ML/DevOps expertise
- Rapid iteration and experimentation phases
- Variable or unpredictable workloads

### Popular Local Model Platforms

| Platform | Type | Ease of Use | Best For |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Ollama | Desktop tool | Very Easy | Local development, testing |
| LM Studio | Desktop GUI | Very Easy | Experimentation, demos |
| vLLM | Serving engine | Moderate | Production inference |
| Text Generation Inference | Serving engine | Moderate | Production inference |
| LocalAI | API server | Easy | OpenAI-compatible API |
| Hugging Face Inference | Managed service | Easy | Prototyping, low-volume |

### Cost Summary - Local Models

**For Tamma MVP:**
- **Not Recommended:** High upfront cost, maintenance complexity, uncertain ROI
- **Consider Later:** Once usage patterns are established (Epic 3-4)
- **Best Use Case:** Specialized models for specific tasks (code analysis, refactoring)

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. Start with API-based providers for MVP (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
2. Monitor usage patterns and costs over 6-12 months
3. Evaluate self-hosting if monthly API costs exceed $10,000
4. Consider hybrid approach: APIs for orchestrator, local models for workers
