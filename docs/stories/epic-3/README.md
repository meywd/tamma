# Epic 3: Quality Gates & Intelligence Layer

This directory contains all stories and context files for Epic 3, which implements quality gates, testing infrastructure, and intelligence capabilities.

## Epic Overview

**Goal**: Add build automation, test execution, CI/CD integration with 3-retry limits and mandatory escalation. Implement research capability, clarifying questions, ambiguity detection, and multi-option design proposals.

**Value Delivered**: Quality enforcement through automated gates (no bypass), intelligent handling of ambiguous requirements, prevention-first mindset.

**MVP Critical**: All stories in Epic 3 are required for MVP - quality gates prevent Tamma from breaking itself during self-maintenance, mandatory escalation ensures Tamma never gets stuck.
