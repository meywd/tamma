# Story 1.99: Test Story Pattern Validation

Status: drafted

## Story

As a developer,
I want to validate the new story organization pattern,
so that BMad workflows follow the established epic-X/story-Y-Z structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Story follows epic-X/story-Y-Z/ folder pattern
2. [ ] Context file is generated in same folder
3. [ ] Task breakdown files follow naming convention
4. [ ] BMad workflows can locate and process files correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify folder structure
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Generate context file
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create task breakdown files
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test workflow integration

## Task Breakdown Files

<!-- Individual task breakdown files will be generated as:
- 1-99-test-story-pattern-task-1.md
- 1-99-test-story-pattern-task-2.md
- 1-99-test-story-pattern-task-3.md
- 1-99-test-story-pattern-task-4.md
-->

## Dev Notes

- Alignment with test-platform structure established earlier
- No conflicts detected with existing structure
