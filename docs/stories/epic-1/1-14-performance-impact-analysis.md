# Story 1.7: Performance Impact Analysis

Status: drafted

## Story

As a Tamma system optimizer,
I want to analyze how agent customizations affect development performance metrics,
So that I can make data-driven decisions about agent optimization and measure ROI of customizations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comprehensive performance impact analysis across speed, quality, cost, and success rate metrics
2. Statistical significance testing for agent customization improvements
3. Context window efficiency measurement and optimization recommendations
4. Cross-agent comparison showing relative performance of customizations
5. Historical trend analysis for agent performance over time
6. Cost-benefit analysis for agent customizations vs. stock configurations
7. Automated insight generation identifying effective customization patterns
8. Integration with Test Platform's dual-purpose benchmarking results
