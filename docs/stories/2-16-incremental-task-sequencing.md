# Story 2.16: Incremental Task Sequencing

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want Tamma to sequence small tasks for continuous integration and delivery,
so that value is delivered incrementally with minimal integration risk.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System creates optimal task execution sequences based on dependencies, risk, and value delivery
2. Incremental delivery strategy ensures each task provides measurable value when completed
3. Integration checkpoints validate that completed tasks work together before proceeding
4. Rollback capability exists for each incremental step to maintain system stability
5. Feature flags enable/disable completed tasks for controlled rollout
6. Continuous integration pipeline automatically tests each incremental task
7. Progress tracking shows cumulative value delivery and remaining work
8. Task sequencing adapts based on feedback and changing priorities

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 2 Autonomous Loop:** This story enables the autonomous loop to deliver value incrementally rather than waiting for complete feature implementation, improving time-to-market and reducing risk.

**Continuous Delivery:** Incremental sequencing supports modern CI/CD practices where small, valuable changes are delivered continuously.

**Risk Management:** Delivering incrementally reduces the risk of large, monolithic deployments and enables faster feedback cycles.

**Value Optimization:** Sequencing based on value delivery ensures stakeholders see benefits as early as possible.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/sequencing/` for sequencing logic.

**CI/CD Integration:** Works with existing CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployment.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with task decomposition (Story 2.14), dependency mapping (Story 2.15), and Git platform operations.
