# Story 2.14: Issue Decomposition Engine

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **development team lead**,
I want Tamma to automatically break large issues into smaller, implementable tasks,
so that complex features can be developed incrementally with continuous integration and delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System analyzes issue complexity and determines when decomposition is needed (based on size, scope, dependencies)
2. Decomposition algorithm breaks issues into logical subtasks with clear acceptance criteria for each
3. Task dependencies identified and mapped (sequential, parallel, blocking relationships)
4. Each subtask sized appropriately (2-8 hours of work) with clear definition of done
5. Decomposition preserves original issue intent and business value
6. Subtasks linked to parent issue with traceability and rollup reporting
7. Human approval required before executing decomposed tasks, with ability to modify decomposition
8. System learns from decomposition patterns to improve future breakdown quality

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create issue complexity analysis system (AC: 1)

  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add pattern recognition for complex issue types

- [ ] Task 2: Build decomposition algorithm (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create decomposition strategies (vertical slicing, horizontal layering, feature breakdown)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement AI-powered task generation with clear acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Add validation to ensure subtasks are complete and implementable

- [ ] Task 3: Implement dependency mapping system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create DependencyGraph class for task relationships

  - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Track decomposition success metrics (completion time, revision rate, user satisfaction)
  - [ ] Subtask 7.2: Implement pattern learning from successful decompositions
  - [ ] Subtask 7.3: Add decomposition quality scoring and improvement recommendations

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 2 Autonomous Loop:** This story enables the autonomous loop to handle complex issues by breaking them into manageable pieces, supporting incremental development and continuous integration.

**Incremental Delivery:** Large features should be delivered incrementally through smaller, testable units rather than monolithic implementations.

**Dependency Management:** Understanding task dependencies is crucial for proper sequencing and avoiding integration issues.

**Human Oversight:** While decomposition can be automated, human approval ensures the breakdown aligns with business intent and technical constraints.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/decomposition/` for decomposition logic.

**AI Integration:** Uses AI providers to analyze issues and generate logical subtask breakdowns.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with issue analysis (Story 2.2), development planning (Story 2.3), and Git platform operations (Stories 1.4-1.6).
