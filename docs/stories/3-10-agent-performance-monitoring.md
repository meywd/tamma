# Story 3.10: Agent Performance Monitoring

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **system operator**,
I want to monitor AI agent performance metrics and response quality,
so that I can identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure consistent autonomous development quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System tracks comprehensive performance metrics for each AI provider and task type combination
2. Metrics include: response time, success rate, token usage, cost per task, revision count, quality score
3. Real-time dashboard displays current performance with historical trends and alerts for anomalies
4. Performance baselines established per provider/task type with automatic deviation detection
5. Quality scoring system evaluates AI responses based on code quality, test coverage, and user feedback
6. Automated alerts trigger when performance degrades beyond thresholds (response time, success rate, cost)
7. Performance reports generated daily/weekly with insights and optimization recommendations
8. Historical performance data used to inform provider selection and prompt optimization

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 3 Quality Gates:** This story provides the monitoring foundation for ensuring AI agents maintain high performance and quality standards throughout autonomous development.

**Performance Visibility:** Without comprehensive monitoring, it's impossible to know if AI agents are performing well or degrading over time. This visibility is essential for reliable autonomous operation.

**Quality Assurance:** Performance monitoring enables proactive identification of issues before they impact development quality, supporting the overall quality gate strategy.

**Data-Driven Optimization:** Historical performance data informs both provider selection (Story 2.12) and prompt optimization (Story 2.13), creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/observability/src/performance/` for monitoring logic, dashboard components in `packages/dashboard/src/`.

**Metrics Storage:** Use time-series database (InfluxDB or Prometheus) for efficient metric storage and querying.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with AI provider abstraction (Story 1.1), event sourcing (Epic 4), and alert system (Story 5.6).
