# Story 2.12: Intelligent Provider Selection

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **system operator**,
I want Tamma to automatically select the optimal AI provider based on task type, cost, and availability,
so that development tasks are completed efficiently while staying within budget constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System analyzes task characteristics (code generation, review, research, testing) to determine optimal provider
2. Provider selection algorithm considers: task complexity, required capabilities, cost per token, response speed, current load
3. System maintains provider performance metrics (success rate, average response time, cost efficiency) for each task type
4. Fallback logic automatically switches providers when primary provider is unavailable or rate-limited
5. Cost-aware routing prioritizes cheaper providers for simple tasks, premium providers for complex tasks
6. Provider selection logged to event trail with rationale (why this provider was chosen)
7. Configuration allows override of automatic selection per task type or provider

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define task classification system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create TaskType enum (CODE_GENERATION, CODE_REVIEW, RESEARCH, TESTING, REFACTORING)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Define task complexity metrics (lines of code, domain complexity, integration points)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Implement task analysis engine to classify incoming requests

- [ ] Task 2: Implement provider scoring algorithm (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create ProviderScorer class with weighted scoring system
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement performance metrics tracking (success rate, response time, cost)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Add scoring factors: capability match, cost efficiency, availability, performance history

- [ ] Task 3: Build fallback and failover logic (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Implement provider health monitoring (rate limits, availability)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create fallback provider chain for each task type
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Add automatic provider switching on failures

- [ ] Task 4: Implement cost-aware routing (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Define cost thresholds per task type
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement cost-benefit analysis for provider selection
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Add budget-aware provider prioritization

- [ ] Task 5: Add audit trail and configuration (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Log provider selection decisions with full rationale
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Create configuration schema for provider overrides
  - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Add CLI commands for provider performance monitoring

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 2 Autonomous Loop:** This story enhances the core autonomous development loop by ensuring optimal AI provider selection for each task type, improving both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

**Task Classification:** Different AI providers excel at different tasks. Claude Code may be best for code generation, while OpenAI might be better for code review. The system must intelligently match tasks to providers.

**Cost Optimization:** Autonomous development can generate significant AI costs. Intelligent provider selection is essential for staying within budget while maintaining quality.

**Reliability:** Provider failures or rate limits should not halt development. The system must gracefully switch between providers to maintain continuous operation.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/provider-selector.ts` for the selection logic, following the intelligence package structure.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with existing AI provider abstraction (Story 1.1) and event sourcing (Epic 4) for audit trail.

**Performance Considerations:** Provider selection must be fast (<100ms) to avoid adding latency to the autonomous loop.
