# Story 3.11: Cost-Aware AI Usage

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **project manager**,
I want Tamma to optimize AI usage to stay within budget constraints while maintaining development quality,
so that autonomous development remains cost-effective and predictable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System tracks AI costs in real-time with breakdown by provider, task type, and project
2. Budget management system supports daily, weekly, and monthly spending limits with configurable alerts
3. Cost optimization strategies automatically reduce usage when approaching budget limits (cheaper providers, fewer retries, simplified prompts)
4. Cost forecasting predicts future spending based on current usage patterns and upcoming tasks
5. Cost-benefit analysis evaluates whether AI usage for specific tasks provides sufficient value
6. Spending reports provide detailed breakdown with insights and cost-saving recommendations
7. Emergency cost controls can immediately halt AI usage when critical budget thresholds are exceeded
8. Cost optimization doesn't compromise critical quality gates (security, testing, code review)

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 3 Quality Gates:** This story adds cost management as an additional quality gate, ensuring autonomous development remains financially sustainable.

**Budget Predictability:** Autonomous development can generate significant AI costs. Budget management and forecasting are essential for project planning and financial control.

**Cost Optimization:** Intelligent cost reduction strategies enable continued operation within budget constraints while maintaining development velocity.

**Value-Based Decisions:** Cost-benefit analysis ensures AI usage provides sufficient value, preventing wasteful spending on low-impact tasks.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/cost/` for cost tracking and optimization logic.

**Pricing Models:** Support various pricing models (per-token, per-request, subscription) across different providers.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with provider selection (Story 2.12), performance monitoring (Story 3.10), and budget management systems.
