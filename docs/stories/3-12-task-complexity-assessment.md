# Story 3.12: Task Complexity Assessment

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **development team lead**,
I want Tamma to estimate task complexity and determine appropriate decomposition level,
so that tasks are sized optimally for autonomous development and reliable completion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System analyzes multiple complexity dimensions (technical difficulty, integration points, uncertainty, scope)
2. Complexity scoring algorithm provides quantitative assessment (0-100 scale) with qualitative descriptors
3. Historical accuracy tracking compares estimated vs actual complexity to improve predictions
4. Decomposition recommendations suggest optimal task breakdown based on complexity scores
5. Complexity factors identified and explained (why task is complex/simplistic)
6. Risk assessment identifies potential blockers and failure points for each complexity level
7. Time estimation correlates with complexity scores for planning and scheduling
8. Complexity assessment integrates with provider selection and resource allocation

### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 3 Quality Gates:** This story provides the foundation for intelligent task management by accurately assessing complexity, enabling better planning and resource allocation.

**Task Sizing:** Proper complexity assessment ensures tasks are sized appropriately for autonomous development, avoiding both over-simplification and overwhelming complexity.

**Risk Management:** Understanding complexity helps identify potential issues before they impact development, supporting proactive risk mitigation.

**Resource Optimization:** Complexity-aware resource allocation ensures appropriate AI providers and strategies are selected for each task.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/complexity/` for complexity analysis logic.

**Machine Learning:** Uses historical data to improve complexity prediction accuracy over time.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with issue decomposition (Story 2.14), provider selection (Story 2.12), and task scheduling.
