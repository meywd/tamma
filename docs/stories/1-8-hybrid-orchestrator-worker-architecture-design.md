# Story 1.8: Hybrid Orchestrator/Worker Architecture Design

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **system architect**,
I want documented architecture for orchestrator mode and worker mode,
so that system can operate both as autonomous coordinator and as CI/CD-invoked worker.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Architecture document defines orchestrator mode responsibilities (issue selection, loop coordination, state management)
2. Architecture document defines worker mode responsibilities (CI/CD integration, single-task execution, exit codes)
3. Document includes sequence diagrams for both modes
4. Document specifies shared components (AI abstraction, Git abstraction, quality gates)
5. Document defines state persistence strategy for graceful shutdown/restart
6. Architecture reviewed and approved by technical lead

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- Implements hybrid architecture pattern supporting both orchestrator (stateful coordinator) and worker (stateless executor) modes
- Orchestrator mode: Fastify HTTP server, REST API, WebSocket streaming, PostgreSQL task queue, worker pool management
- Worker mode: Stateless execution engine, task polling, local filesystem access, result reporting via HTTP callbacks
- Shared components: Configuration loader, event emitter, logging infrastructure, health check endpoints
- Integrates with AI provider abstraction from Stories 1.1-1.3 and Git platform abstraction from Stories 1.4-1.7

### Project Structure Notes
- Implementation location: packages/orchestrator/ and packages/worker/
- Orchestrator components: src/index.ts, src/orchestrator.ts, src/task-queue.ts, src/worker-pool.ts
- Worker components: src/index.ts, src/worker.ts, src/task-executor.ts
- Shared components: packages/config/, packages/events/, packages/logger/
- API routes: packages/orchestrator/src/routes/
- Database migrations: packages/orchestrator/migrations/

### Technology Stack
- Fastify web framework for HTTP server and WebSocket support
- PostgreSQL for task queue persistence and worker registry
- Event bus integration for DCB event sourcing
- Structured logging with Pino
- Health check endpoints for monitoring and observability
