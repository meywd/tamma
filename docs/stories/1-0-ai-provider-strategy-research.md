# Story 1-0: AI Provider Strategy Research

Status: completed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:

- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **technical architect**,
I want to research AI provider options across cost models, capabilities, and workflow fit,
so that I can make informed decisions about which AI providers to support and when to use each.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Research document compares at least 5 AI providers: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, local models (Ollama/LM Studio)
2. Cost analysis includes: subscription plans, pay-as-you-go rates, volume discounts, free tiers
3. Capability matrix maps providers to Tamma workflow steps: issue analysis, code generation, test generation, code review, refactoring, documentation
4. Integration approach evaluated: SDK/API (headless), IDE extensions, CLI tools, self-hosted models
5. Deployment compatibility assessed: orchestrator mode, worker mode, CI/CD environments, developer workstations
6. Recommendation matrix produced: Primary provider for MVP, secondary providers for specific workflows, long-term extensibility strategy
7. Cost projection calculated: estimated monthly spend for 10 users, 100 issues/month, 3 workflows/issue

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**

1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)

### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 1 Foundation:** This research story informs the AI provider implementation strategy for Epic 1. The findings will determine which provider(s) to implement in Story 1-2 and guide the long-term provider extensibility roadmap.

**Strategic Importance:** AI providers are the core engine of Tamma's autonomous development capabilities. Choosing the right provider(s) affects:

- **Cost**: Monthly operational expenses for users
- **Quality**: Success rate of autonomous workflows
- **Flexibility**: Ability to optimize per workflow step
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Long-term dependency risk

**Research Methodology:**

1. **Cost Analysis**: Compare pricing models (API tokens, subscriptions, enterprise plans)
2. **Capability Testing**: Run sample workflows through each provider
3. **Integration Assessment**: Evaluate SDK maturity, auth flows, deployment models
4. **Deployment Validation**: Test in orchestrator, worker, CI/CD, and local dev environments

**Key Questions to Answer:**

1. Should we use **one provider for everything** or **multiple providers per workflow step**?
2. Which pricing model is most cost-effective: **pay-as-you-go** or **subscription**?
3. Can we use **subscription plans** (e.g., Anthropic Teams, GitHub Copilot Business) to reduce per-user costs?
4. Which providers support **headless/programmatic** access (required for orchestrator mode)?
5. Should we support **local models** for air-gapped/cost-sensitive deployments?

**Success Criteria:** Research must produce a clear recommendation with confidence level (High/Medium/Low) for:

- Primary provider for MVP (Story 1-2 implementation target)
- Optional secondary providers for specialized workflows
- Long-term multi-provider strategy

### Project Structure Notes

**Research Output Location:** `docs/research/ai-provider-strategy-2025-10.md`

**Cost Analysis Spreadsheet:** `docs/research/ai-provider-cost-analysis.xlsx` (optional, can be markdown table)

**Capability Matrix:** Markdown table or CSV in research document

**Test Scripts:** `scripts/research/test-provider-capabilities.ts` (if automated testing performed)

### Workflow Step Definitions for Testing

**Tamma Workflow Steps** (from Epic 2):

1. **Issue Analysis**: Understand requirements, detect ambiguity, identify scope
2. **Development Plan Generation**: Break down issue into implementation steps
3. **Code Generation**: Write implementation code for feature/bugfix
4. **Test Generation**: Write unit/integration tests for new code
5. **Code Refactoring**: Improve code quality (SOLID, design patterns)
6. **Code Review**: Review generated code for security, performance, best practices
7. **Documentation Generation**: Generate docstrings, README updates, API docs
8. **PR Description Generation**: Summarize changes for pull request

**Test Each Provider on Real Scenarios:**

- Issue: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
- Expected Output: Code, tests, refactoring suggestions, review feedback

### Cost Projection Assumptions

**User Scenarios:**

- **10 Users (Small Team)**: 100 issues/month, 3 AI interactions per issue = 300 AI requests/month
- **100 Users (Mid-Size)**: 1,000 issues/month, 3 AI interactions per issue = 3,000 AI requests/month
- **1,000 Users (Enterprise)**: 10,000 issues/month, 3 AI interactions per issue = 30,000 AI requests/month

**Token Estimates per Interaction:**

- Issue Analysis: ~2,000 tokens input, ~1,000 tokens output
- Code Generation: ~5,000 tokens input, ~3,000 tokens output
- Test Generation: ~3,000 tokens input, ~2,000 tokens output
- Code Review: ~4,000 tokens input, ~1,000 tokens output

**Calculate Costs:**

- Pay-as-you-go: Tokens √ó Rate per Million Tokens
- Subscription: Monthly fee per user (if available)
- Compare total cost for each scenario
