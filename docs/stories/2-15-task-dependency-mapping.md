# Story 2.15: Task Dependency Mapping

Status: ready-for-dev

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before You Code

**ALL contributors MUST read and follow the comprehensive development process:**

üìñ **[BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)**

This mandatory guide includes:
- 7-Phase Development Workflow (Read ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Break Down ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Failure Handling)
- Knowledge Base Usage (.dev/ directory: spikes, bugs, findings, decisions)
- TRACE/DEBUG Logging Requirements for all functions
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) mandatory workflow
- 100% Test Coverage requirement
- Build Success enforcement
- Automatic retry and developer alert procedures

**Failure to follow this process will result in rework.**

## Story

As a **project manager**,
I want Tamma to identify and manage dependencies between development tasks,
so that tasks are executed in the correct order and integration conflicts are avoided.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System automatically detects dependencies between tasks (code dependencies, data model changes, API modifications)
2. Dependency types classified: blocking (must complete first), parallel (can run simultaneously), optional (nice to have)
3. Visual dependency graph shows task relationships and critical path analysis
4. Dependency validation ensures task prerequisites are met before execution begins
5. Circular dependency detection prevents infinite loops and deadlock situations
6. Impact analysis identifies downstream effects when tasks are modified or delayed
7. Dependency-aware scheduling optimizes task execution order for maximum parallelism
8. Dependency updates automatically propagate when tasks change scope or requirements

## Dev Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Process Reminder

**Before implementing this story, ensure you have:**
1. ‚úÖ Read [BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md](../../BEFORE_YOU_CODE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Searched `.dev/` directory for related spikes, bugs, findings, and decisions
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed relevant documentation in `docs/` directory
4. ‚úÖ Checked existing code patterns for similar functionality
5. ‚úÖ Planned TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)


### Requirements Context Summary

**Epic 2 Autonomous Loop:** This story enhances the autonomous loop with dependency awareness, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and preventing integration issues.

**Parallel Development:** Understanding dependencies enables safe parallel development, improving development velocity while avoiding conflicts.

**Risk Management:** Dependency mapping identifies potential bottlenecks and risks before they impact development timeline.

**Integration Prevention:** Proper dependency management prevents integration issues and ensures smooth continuous delivery.

### Project Structure Notes

**Package Location:** `packages/intelligence/src/dependencies/` for dependency analysis logic.

**Graph Algorithms:** Uses graph theory for dependency analysis, cycle detection, and critical path analysis.

**Integration Points:** Integrates with issue decomposition (Story 2.14), task scheduling, and Git operations.
