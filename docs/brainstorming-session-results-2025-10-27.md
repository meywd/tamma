## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: What If Scenarios

**Goal:** Explore radical possibilities for CCM capabilities

**Key Scenarios Generated:**

1. **What if CCM could autonomously research, design, and implement features?**
   - User describes high-level goal (e.g., "Hotel reservation system")
   - CCM researches existing solutions, asks clarifying questions
   - Generates multiple design options, creates spec-complete implementation plans
   - Implements features autonomously when specs are clear

2. **What if CCM had complete cost and quality intelligence?**
   - Real-time cost comparison across hosting vendors
   - Warnings for potential high costs, bad UX, privacy issues, security vulnerabilities
   - Integration problem detection before deployment

3. **What if CCM orchestrated parallel development agents?**
   - Defines parallel dev paths for independent features
   - Launches multiple agents working concurrently
   - Monitors for merge conflicts before integration
   - Uses standard CI/CD tools (Dependabot, etc.)

4. **What if CCM provided complete observability?**
   - Full logs and audit trail (debug + trace level)
   - Analytics on every action and screen
   - User feedback loops (suggestions, polls, behavior tracking)
   - Incentivized feedback without spam

5. **What if CCM enabled feature experimentation?**
   - Features with independent on/off toggles
   - A/B testing with cost analysis
   - Feature goal tracking and ROI measurement

6. **What if CCM abstracted all technical complexity?**
   - Plug-and-play or drag-drop feature management
   - No-code layer for non-developers

**Insights:** The "what if" exploration revealed CCM should be more than a task runner - it should be an **intelligent development partner** with autonomous capabilities, cost awareness, and proactive quality management.

### Technique 2: SCAMPER (Systematic Innovation)

**Goal:** Systematically explore modifications to standard development workflow

#### S - Substitute

**What can we replace in the traditional dev process?**

- **UX/UI Design** → AI-generated designs with multiple concepts, UX best practices, user feedback incorporation
- **UI Implementation** → Automated after approval, with cross-platform testing
- **Testing** → UX automated testing, E2E tests, cross-platform, security, penetration, privacy compliance
- **Project Management** → Autonomous PM for task breakdown and scheduling
- **DevOps** → Automated infrastructure management
- **Customer Support** → Tiered approach:
  - L1: Human (initial contact)
  - L2: CCM (automated resolution)
  - L3: Human (complex escalation)

#### C - Combine

**What can we merge into unified systems?**

- **Unified Dev Pipeline**: Dev + Build + Debug + Test + Deploy + Monitor + E2E execution
- **Intelligence Hub**: Research + Brainstorming + Decision automation (configurable: high automation with less feedback OR low automation with more involvement)
- **Quality + Security**: Integrated testing with cross-platform, visual, package updates, CVE tracking
- **Infrastructure Intelligence**:
  - Debugger + Network assistant
  - Availability assistant
  - Cloud migration plans
  - Disaster recovery plans

#### A - Adapt

**What patterns can we borrow from other domains?**

- **Aviation (Black Box)**: Event sourcing with minute-by-minute system reconstruction capability
- **Manufacturing (Quality Gates)**: No-bypass quality enforcement at each stage
- **Healthcare (Differential Diagnosis)**: Systematic debugging approach with symptom analysis
- **Financial (Audit Trail)**: CQRS event sourcing for complete transaction history
- **Zero-Trust Security**: File checksums, input validation, encryption, no-deletion policy

#### M - Modify

**What can we change about the development environment?**

- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic DB-based config instead of static files
- **Build Visibility**: Hidden builds with built-in CI/CD mode
- **Documentation**: Living docs for each step - always current:
  - Flow diagrams (sequence, activity)
  - Database diagrams (ERD)
  - Design diagrams (C4, component)
  - Indices and sample flows
  - Real-time monitoring dashboards (flows, stats, availability, issues, runtime)
- **Deployment Speed**: Environment-based:
  - Dev: Fast with minimal gates
  - QA/Staging/Prod: Slower with progressive gates

#### P - Put to Other Uses

**Can CCM serve additional purposes?**

- **Infrastructure-as-Code Management**: Terraform/CloudFormation automation
- **Teaching System**: Explain code, patterns, best practices
- **Research Assistant**: Core need - autonomous research before implementation
- **Cost Optimizer**: Budget monitoring and issue prevention

#### E - Eliminate

**What friction can we remove?**

- **Configuration Files** → Dynamic DB configuration
- **Hidden Builds** → Built-in CI/CD with transparency
- **Confusion** → Living documentation with real-time dashboards

#### R - Reverse

**What if we flip reactive to proactive?**

- **Infrastructure Monitoring** → Predict needed capacity updates before issues
- **Security Testing** → Penetration tests to fix vulnerabilities before exploitation
- **Performance Monitoring** → Scale up/down based on predicted load
- **Cost Management** → Budget alerts before overspending

**Insights:** SCAMPER revealed the **hybrid architecture requirement** - CCM must be both orchestrator (monitoring, assigning, triggering) AND worker (invokable by CI/CD runners for parallel code/review tasks).

---

### Technique 3: Assumption Reversal

**Goal:** Challenge conventional development assumptions

#### Assumption: "Everything should be automated"

**Reversal:** Some decisions MUST require human approval

**Smart Friction Zones:**
- Business and domain decisions
- Size-based approvals (major refactors, large deletions)
- Breaking changes (NEVER auto-approve)
- Deletions (always require confirmation)
- Deployments (environment-dependent):
  - Dev: Fast, minimal gates
  - QA/Staging: Progressive gates
  - Prod: Maximum gates

**Context-Aware Automation:**
- **Dev Mode**: High automation, minimal friction
- **Business Mode**: More checkpoints, guided decisions

#### Assumption: "AI should always assist passively"

**Reversal:** AI roles should adapt to phase and mode

**Dev Mode Roles:**
- Design Phase: **Consultant** (offer options, explain tradeoffs)
- Implementation Phase: **Autopilot** (autonomous execution with oversight)

**Business Mode Roles:**
- Design Phase: **Advisor** (guide decisions, highlight risks)
- Implementation Phase: **Guardian** (enforce gates, prevent mistakes)

#### Assumption: "Developers should do all technical work"

**Reversal:** CCM should automate high-volume, low-creativity toil

**Automated Toil:**
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Security gates and vulnerability scanning
- Design implementation (after approval)
- Code quality gates (linting, formatting, standards)
- E2E tests including UI spec validation

**High-Value Developer Work:**
- Creative problem solving
- Architecture decisions
- Business logic design
- User experience considerations

#### Assumption: "Logs and metrics are enough for debugging"

**Reversal:** Complete event sourcing enables time-travel debugging

**Radical Transparency:**
- CQRS event sourcing for every action
- Black-box replay: Reconstruct exact system state at any point
- Complete audit trail with millisecond precision
- Auto-generated System Design Documents (SDD)
- All diagrams auto-generated and maintained
- Deep analysis reports for every deployment

**Insights:** The distinction between Dev Mode and Business Mode is **critical for user experience** - the same system should feel like a fast autopilot for developers and a careful guardian for business stakeholders.

### Insights and Learnings

**Key Realizations from the Session:**

1. **CCM is a Hybrid System**: Both orchestrator (monitoring, assigning, triggering workflows) AND worker (invokable by CI/CD runners for parallel code/review tasks). This dual nature is critical for Gitea/Forgejo integration.

2. **Context-Aware Automation is Essential**: The same system must feel different to developers (fast autopilot) vs business stakeholders (careful guardian). Dev Mode and Business Mode are not preferences - they're fundamental UX paradigms.

3. **Smart Friction Beats Full Automation**: Not everything should be automated. Business decisions, breaking changes, and deletions need human approval. The art is knowing where to add friction.

4. **Event Sourcing is the Foundation**: CQRS audit trail isn't just for compliance - it enables time-travel debugging, differential diagnosis, and complete system transparency. This is a competitive advantage.

5. **Quality Gates Cannot Be Bypassed**: 3-retry limit with escalation is non-negotiable. This prevents the "I'll fix it later" mentality that creates technical debt.

6. **Provider Abstraction is Strategic**: Supporting multiple AI providers (Claude Code, OpenCode, GLM, local LLMs) prevents vendor lock-in and enables cost optimization. This must be in the foundation, not added later.

7. **Living Documentation Prevents Drift**: Auto-generated docs from code/architecture/database ensure documentation never lies. The source of truth is the code; docs are projections.

8. **Proactive Beats Reactive**: Predicting infrastructure needs, security issues, and performance bottlenecks before they occur is the difference between good and great systems.

- 3 weeks of focused development

**Timeline:** Weeks 8-10 (3 weeks)

**Success Criteria:**
- Every user/AI action captured as immutable event
- Can reconstruct system state at any point in time
- Debugging question: "What was the state at 2:47 PM yesterday?" → answered
- Compliance question: "Who approved this change and when?" → answered
- Learning question: "Why did the build fail 3 times?" → answered with event trace

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

The **Progressive Technique Flow** approach was highly effective:

1. **What If Scenarios** opened up broad possibilities and established major concept areas
2. **SCAMPER** systematically explored each concept through 7 lenses, revealing critical features
3. **Assumption Reversal** uncovered crucial distinctions (Dev vs Business Mode, smart friction)
4. **Mind Mapping** organized 60+ features into coherent branches

The technique progression moved naturally from divergent (generating ideas) to convergent (organizing and prioritizing), which helped maintain momentum while building depth.

### Areas for Further Exploration

Three critical architecture areas require deep investigation before MVP development:

1. **AI Provider Abstraction Layer** - Multi-provider support (Claude Code, OpenCode, GLM, local LLMs)
2. **Gitea/Forgejo Integration** - Platform-specific runner and review APIs
3. **Hybrid Runner Architecture** - CCM as both orchestrator AND worker invoked by CI/CD runners

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

For the Priority #0 research phase:

- **Pre-Mortem Analysis** - Imagine failures in AI provider switching, runner coordination, Gitea integration
- **Lotus Blossom** - Deep dive into Event Sourcing architecture (core + 8 petals)
- **Six Thinking Hats** - Multi-perspective analysis of the hybrid runner architecture

### Questions That Emerged

1. **State Management**: How do parallel CCM instances coordinate when invoked by runners?
2. **Event Sourcing Scope**: What's the boundary between CQRS audit trail and operational logs?
3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: How to prevent bypass attempts while maintaining developer productivity?
4. **Cost Intelligence**: Real-time cost tracking across cloud providers - minimum viable implementation?
5. **Living Documentation**: Generation trigger - every commit, on PR, or on demand?
6. **No-Code Layer**: Drag-drop for non-developers - post-MVP or part of the vision?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:**
  - Deep dive into Event Sourcing architecture (Lotus Blossom)
  - Pre-mortem analysis of hybrid runner coordination
  - UX design for Dev Mode vs Business Mode
  - Cost intelligence implementation strategy

- **Recommended timeframe:**
  - After Priority #0 research complete (Week 2)
  - Before Priority #1 Phase 3 begins (Week 6)

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Complete AI provider abstraction research
  - Validate Gitea/Forgejo runner APIs
  - Prototype hybrid architecture coordination
