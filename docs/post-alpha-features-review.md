# Post-Alpha Features Review: Unaddressed Out-of-Scope Items

**Generated**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Needs Review
**Epic Coverage**: Epics 1-5 (All contexted)

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of all Epic technical specifications (1-5) reveals **27 features explicitly marked as out-of-scope** across all epics that remain **unaddressed in the alpha release**. These items represent strategic decisions to defer functionality to post-alpha iterations, future epics, or community-driven extensibility.

**Key Findings**:
- Alpha focuses on **single-tenant, English-only, Claude Code + GitHub/GitLab** deployment
- Most deferred items fall into **extensibility, enterprise features, and advanced intelligence**
- Several items will require **significant architectural changes** if added later (multi-tenancy, multi-repo support)
- Post-alpha priorities should be driven by **early adopter feedback** and **adoption blockers**

---

## 1. Extensibility & Plugin Systems (4 items)

**Status**: Deferred to future epics (post-alpha)
**Priority**: HIGH (critical for broad adoption)

### Items

1. **Additional AI Providers Beyond Anthropic Claude** (Epic 1)

## Strategic Implications

### Alpha Release Scope Validation

âœ… **Alpha Scope is Well-Defined**: Core autonomous loop with Claude Code + GitHub/GitLab
âœ… **Deferred Items are Strategic**: Focus on MVP, defer complexity and enterprise features
âœ… **Technical Debt Manageable**: Most deferred items can be added without major refactoring (except multi-tenancy, multi-repo)

### Post-Alpha Priority Framework

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Extensibility & Adoption Blockers**
1. Additional AI providers (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic API)
2. Multi-tenant architecture (if SaaS planned)
3. Multi-repository workflows (if microservices adoption critical)
4. GitLab CI support (if GitLab users significant)

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Enterprise & Operations**
1. Cloud blob storage (S3/Azure)
2. Interactive CLI/TUI
3. Additional Git platforms (Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
4. Event schema migration automation

**Phase 3 (Months 6-9): Advanced Features**
1. Multi-language support (if international demand)
2. Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
3. Custom quality gate plugins
4. Code review agent

**Phase 4 (Months 9-12): Optimization & Scale**
1. ML-based intelligence features
2. Advanced analytics
3. Custom dashboard widgets
4. Cost tracking and billing (if SaaS)

### Decision Gates

**Before Phase 1**:
- [ ] Survey early adopters for top feature requests
- [ ] Determine SaaS vs. self-hosted strategy (affects multi-tenancy priority)
- [ ] Measure AI provider usage (Claude Code adoption rate)
- [ ] Analyze repository types (monolith vs. microservices split)

**Before Phase 2**:
- [ ] Review technical debt from alpha (any architectural refactors needed?)
- [ ] Validate Phase 1 features with users (did extensibility unblock adoption?)
- [ ] Re-prioritize based on adoption metrics

**Before Phase 3**:
- [ ] Evaluate enterprise customer pipeline (does it justify enterprise features?)
- [ ] Assess competition landscape (what features differentiate Tamma?)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Post-Alpha Release)

1. **Create `ROADMAP.md`** - Public roadmap with Phase 1-4 features for transparency
2. **User Feedback Survey** - Survey first 100 alpha users on top feature requests
3. **Usage Analytics** - Instrument telemetry to track:
   - AI provider usage (Claude Code vs. others)
   - Git platform usage (GitHub vs. GitLab ratio)
   - Repository types (monolith vs. microservices)
   - Workflow failures (escalation reasons, retry patterns)
4. **Technical Debt Review** - Identify any alpha implementation shortcuts requiring Phase 1 refactoring

### Post-Alpha Epic Planning

**Candidate Epics for Post-Alpha**:

- **Epic 6: Extensibility Framework** - AI provider plugins, Git platform plugins, quality gate plugins
